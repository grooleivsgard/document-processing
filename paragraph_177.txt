Though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different employments of labour and stock; yet a certain proportion seems commonly to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different employments of labour, and the pecuniary profits in all the different employments of stock.

I shall, in the third place, endeavour to explain all the different circumstances which regulate this proportion.
