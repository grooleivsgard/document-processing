# Gensim-NLTK Paragraph Processor
This repository presents tools for indexing and querying paragraphs from the book 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations' by Adam Smith. Leveraging the Gensim library for topic modelling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval, alongside NLTK for advanced text processing, the project aims to serve the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) communities.

# Features:
- Document Partitioning: Splits the book into individual paragraphs, each saved as separate files.
- Text Preprocessing: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and other advanced preprocessing techniques.
- Indexing and Querying: Indexes the paragraphs and query them to retrieve the most relevant content based on the LSI (over TF-IDF) model.
- Visualization: Plots a frequency distribution graph of the top 15 words after preprocessing.
